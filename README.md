# API Assignment

Before SantiagoÂ´s course I did not know what an API was. I followed his very good teaching and now I have an understanding of what an API is and how it is used. I picked up some things like always to use patch when editing and tried using Postman for the first time. I also now understand why people like back end development as supposed to front end, as there is less input from the clients and the coders are in full control of the systems they set up. 

Here is an overview of what we learned in the course:
